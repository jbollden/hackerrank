# 30 days of code

Here I've gathered my suggested solutions in [Go](https://golang.org/) for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)'s [30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code).

For the following days Go has not been a selectable language, thus the solutions haven't been tested on HackerRank:

* Day 1: Data Types
* Day 12: Inheritance
* Day 13: Abstract Classes (seems there are no abstract classes in Go)
* Day 14: Scope
